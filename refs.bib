Then we give the definition of a correct and complete type-checking algorithm for terms in normal form. We extend the results to proof-irrelevant propositions.},

Examples include finite-dimensional vector spaces, untyped and typed $\lambda$-calculus syntax and indexed containers. We show that the Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore constructions carry over to relative monads and are related to relative adjunctions. Under reasonable assumptions, relative monads are monoids in the functor category concerned and extend to monads, giving rise to a coreflection between monads and relative monads. Arrows are also an instance of relative monads.},

  abstract = {We show how to construct a logical relation for countable nondeterminism in a guarded type theory, corresponding to the internal logic of the topos Sh $\omega$ 1 of sheaves over $\omega$ 1. In contrast to earlier work on abstract step-indexed models, we not only construct the logical relations in the guarded type theory, but also give an internal proof of the adequacy of the model with respect to standard contextual equivalence. To state and prove adequacy of the logical relation, we introduce a new propositional modality. In connection with this modality we show why it is necessary to work in the logic of bf Sh$\omega$ 1.},

  abstract = {Facile is a symmetric integration of concurrent and functional programming. The language supports both function and process abstraction. Functions may be defined and used within processes, and processes can be dynamically created during expression evaluation. In this work we present two different descriptions of the operational semantics of Facile. First, we develop a structural operational semantics for a small core subset of Facile using a labeled transition system. Such a semantics is useful for reasoning about the operational behavior of Facile programs. We then provide an abstract model of implementation for Facile: theConcurrent and Functional Abstract Machine (C-FAM). The C-FAM executes concurrent processes evaluating functional expressions. The implementation semantics includes compilation rules from Facile to C-FAM instructions and execution rules for the abstract machine. This level of semantic description is suitable for those interested in implementations.},

At a second level of complexity, dependent polynomials and indexed containers handle more sophisticated data types in which the data have an associated indices which can be used to store important computational information. The crucial and salient feature of dependent polynomials and indexed containers is that the index types are defined in advance of the data. At the most sophisticated level, induction-recursion allows us to define data and indices simultaneously.},

The advantage of this over earlier approaches by Plotkin and Statman is its simplicity and universality. Yet, decidability of lambda definability for hereditarily finite Henkin models remains an open problem. But if the variable set allowed in terms is also restricted to be finite then our techniques lead to a decision procedure.},

The corresponding C(P f P f )-coalgebra, where C(P f P f ) is the cofree comonad on P f P f , describes derivations by resolution. Using lax semantics, that correspondence may be extended to a class of first-order logic programs without existential variables. The resulting extension captures the proofs by term-matching resolution in logic programming. Refining the lax ap- proach, we further extend it to arbitrary logic programs. We also exhibit a refinement of Bonchi and Zanasi?s saturation semantics for logic pro- gramming that complements lax semantics.},

The language, a variant of ML, allows an entire distributed application to be developed and reasoned about as a unified program. The language supports transparent mobility of any kind of code or data, but its type system, based on modal logic, statically excludes programs that use mobile resources unsafely. The ML5 compiler produces code for all of the hosts that may be involved in the computation. These hosts may be heterogeneous, with different resources and even different architectures. Currently, our compiler and runtime are specialized to the particular case of web programming: a distributed computation with two sites, the web browser and the web server.},

  abstract = {We propose a new language for writing programs with dependent types on top of the Coq proof assistant. This language permits to establish a phase distinction between writing and proving algorithms in the Coq environment. Concretely, this means allowing to write algorithms as easily as in a practical functional programming language whilst giving them as rich a specification as desired and proving that the code meets the specification using the whole Coq proof apparatus. This is achieved by extending conversion to an equivalence which relates types and subsets based on them, a technique originating from the ``Predicate subtyping'' feature of PVS and following mathematical convention. The typing judgements can be translated to the (CIC) by means of an interpretation which inserts coercions at the appropriate places. These coercions can contain existential variables representing the propositional parts of the final term, corresponding to proof obligations (or PVS type-checking conditions). A prototype implementation of this process is integrated with the Coq environment.},

  abstract = {In his dissertation (1907) Brouwer expressed several remarks concerning the subject which was later called "intuitionistic logic." His strict algorithmic point of view led to rejecting the Ex Falso principle and, unfortunately, to many other consequences. The Ex Falso principle was also rejected in Kolmogorov's 1925 paper on logic. However, in 1932, using the "intended interpretation" (interpretation problem), Kolmogorov concluded that this rule should be accepted. Heyting's proof interpretation led to the same conclusion. Here the role of implication and negation in the Ex Falso principle in the works of Brouwer, Kolmogorov, and Heyting is studied. It is asserted that the 1907 point of view of Brouwer is too strict to create a satisfactory logic, and Brouwer exceeds the bounds of minimal logic in his understanding of implication. The above points of view are compared, and it is concluded that the interpretation problem and the proof interpretation, understood correctly, admit the full intuitionistic logic.},

He did so in his dissertation of 1907, where he formulated the basic act of creation of mathematical objects, known as the ur-intuition of mathematics. Mathematics, in Brouwer's view, was an intellectual activity of men (of the subject), independent of language and logic. The objects of mathematics come first in the process of human cognition, and description and systematization (in particular logic) follow later. The formulation of the ur-intuition is somewhat hermetic, but in view of its fundamental role, let us reproduce it here.},

  abstract = {In total functional (co)programming valid programs are guaranteed to always produce (part of) their output in a finite number of steps. Enforcing this property while not sacrificing expressivity has been challenging. Traditionally systems like Agda and Coq have relied on a syntactic restriction on (co)recursive calls, but this is inherently anti-modular. Guarded recursion, first introduced by Nakano, has been recently applied in the coprogramming case to ensure totality through typing instead. The relationship between the consumption and the production of data is captured by a delay modality, which allows to give a safe type to a general fixpoint combinator. This thesis consists of two parts. In the first we formalize, using the proof assistant Agda, a result about strong normalization for a small language extended with guarded recursive types. In the second we extend guarded recursive types to additionally ensure termination of recursive programs: the main result is a model based on relational parametricity for the dependently typed calculus we designed.},
