                  with a P f P f -coalgebra on the set of atomic
                  propositions in the program. The corresponding C(P f
                  P f )-coalgebra, where C(P f P f ) is the cofree
                  comonad on P f P f , describes derivations by
                  resolution. Using lax semantics, that correspondence
                  may be extended to a class of first-order logic
                  programs without existential variables. The
                  resulting extension captures the proofs by
                  term-matching resolution in logic
                  programming. Refining the lax ap- proach, we further
                  extend it to arbitrary logic programs. We also
                  exhibit a refinement of Bonchi and Zanasi?s
                  saturation semantics for logic pro- gramming that
                  complements lax semantics.},

  abstract =     {In his dissertation (1907) Brouwer expressed several
                  remarks concerning the subject which was later
                  called "intuitionistic logic." His strict
                  algorithmic point of view led to rejecting the Ex
                  Falso principle and, unfortunately, to many other
                  consequences. The Ex Falso principle was also
                  rejected in Kolmogorov's 1925 paper on
                  logic. However, in 1932, using the "intended
                  interpretation" (interpretation problem), Kolmogorov
                  concluded that this rule should be
                  accepted. Heyting's proof interpretation led to the
                  same conclusion. Here the role of implication and
                  negation in the Ex Falso principle in the works of
                  Brouwer, Kolmogorov, and Heyting is studied. It is
                  asserted that the 1907 point of view of Brouwer is
                  too strict to create a satisfactory logic, and
                  Brouwer exceeds the bounds of minimal logic in his
                  understanding of implication. The above points of
                  view are compared, and it is concluded that the
                  interpretation problem and the proof interpretation,
                  understood correctly, admit the full intuitionistic
                  logic.}
