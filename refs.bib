Models for the $\nu$-calculus that validate basic equivalences concerning names may be constructed using functor categories or nominal sets, with a dynamic allocation monad used to model computations that may allocate fresh names. If recursion is added to the language and one attempts to adapt the models from (nominal) sets to (nominal) domains, however, the direct-style construction of the allocation monad no longer works. This issue has previously been addressed by using a monad that combines dynamic allocation with continuations, at some cost to abstraction.},

We use the bijective correspondence between innocent well-bracketed strategies and PCF B\"{o}hm trees, and show how operations on PCF B\"{o}hm trees, such as composition, can be computed lazily and simply by nbe. The usual equations characteristic of games follow from the nbe construction without reference to low-level game-theoretic machinery. As an illustration, we give a Haskell program computing the application of innocent strategies.},

For this we use a general method to transform some logically complex first-order formulae in a geometrical form which may be interesting in itself.},

  abstract = {The method of logical relations assigns a relational interpretation to types that expresses operational invariants satisfied by all terms of a type. The method is widely used in the study of typed languages, for example to establish contextual equivalences of terms. The chief difficulty in using logical relations is to establish the existence of a suitable relational interpretation. We extend work of Pitts and Birkedal and Harper on constructing relational interpretations of types to polymorphism and recursive types, and apply it to establish parametricity and representation independence properties in a purely operational setting. We argue that, once the existence of a relational interpretation has been established, it is straightforward to use it to establish properties of interest.},

  abstract = {In his dissertation (1907) Brouwer expressed several remarks concerning the subject which was later called "intuitionistic logic." His strict algorithmic point of view led to rejecting the Ex Falso principle and, unfortunately, to many other consequences. The Ex Falso principle was also rejected in Kolmogorov's 1925 paper on logic. However, in 1932, using the "intended interpretation" (interpretation problem), Kolmogorov concluded that this rule should be accepted. Heyting's proof interpretation led to the same conclusion. Here the role of implication and negation in the Ex Falso principle in the works of Brouwer, Kolmogorov, and Heyting is studied. It is asserted that the 1907 point of view of Brouwer is too strict to create a satisfactory logic, and Brouwer exceeds the bounds of minimal logic in his understanding of implication. The above points of view are compared, and it is concluded that the interpretation problem and the proof interpretation, understood correctly, admit the full intuitionistic logic.},

He did so in his dissertation of 1907, where he formulated the basic act of creation of mathematical objects, known as the ur-intuition of mathematics. Mathematics, in Brouwer's view, was an intellectual activity of men (of the subject), independent of language and logic. The objects of mathematics come first in the process of human cognition, and description and systematization (in particular logic) follow later. The formulation of the ur-intuition is somewhat hermetic, but in view of its fundamental role, let us reproduce it here.},

  abstract = {Facile is a symmetric integration of concurrent and functional programming. The language supports both function and process abstraction. Functions may be defined and used within processes, and processes can be dynamically created during expression evaluation. In this work we present two different descriptions of the operational semantics of Facile. First, we develop a structural operational semantics for a small core subset of Facile using a labeled transition system. Such a semantics is useful for reasoning about the operational behavior of Facile programs. We then provide an abstract model of implementation for Facile: theConcurrent and Functional Abstract Machine (C-FAM). The C-FAM executes concurrent processes evaluating functional expressions. The implementation semantics includes compilation rules from Facile to C-FAM instructions and execution rules for the abstract machine. This level of semantic description is suitable for those interested in implementations.},

In this paper we prove canonicity for cubical type theory: any natural number in a context build from only name variables is judgmentally equal to a numeral. To achieve this we formulate a typed and deterministic operational semantics and employ a computability argument adapted to a presheaf-like setting.},

This presents an \x{221e}-category of such type theories; we show moreover that there is an \x{221e}-functor Cl\x{221e} from there to the \x{221e}-category of suitably structured quasi-categories. This allows a precise formulation of the conjectures that intensional type theory gives internal languages for higher categories, and provides a framework and toolbox for further progress on these conjectures.},

  abstract = {We present ML5, a high level programming language for spatially distributed computing. The language, a variant of ML, allows an entire distributed application to be developed and reasoned about as a unified program. The language supports transparent mobility of any kind of code or data, but its type system, based on modal logic, statically excludes programs that use mobile resources unsafely. The ML5 compiler produces code for all of the hosts that may be involved in the computation. These hosts may be heterogeneous, with different resources and even different architectures. Currently, our compiler and runtime are specialized to the particular case of web programming: a distributed computation with two sites, the web browser and the web server.},

  abstract = {Reynolds' original theory of relational parametricity was intended to capture the observation that polymorphically typed System F programs preserve all relations between inputs. But as Reynolds himself later showed, his theory can only be formulated in a metatheory with an impredicative universe, such as the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. A number of more abstract treatments of relational parametricity have since appeared; however, as we show, none of these seem to express Reynolds' original theory in a satisfactory way.To correct this, we develop an abstract framework for relational parametricity that delivers a model expressing Reynolds' theory in a direct and natural way. This framework is uniform with respect to a choice of meta-theory, which allows us to obtain the well-known PER model of Longo and Moggi as a direct instance in a natural way as well. Underlying the framework is the novel notion of a \x{03bb}2-fibration with isomorphisms, which relaxes certain strictness requirements on split \x{03bb}2-fibrations. Our main theorem is a generalization of Seely's classical construction of sound models of System F from split \x{03bb}2-fibrations: we prove that the canonical interpretation of System F induced by every \x{03bb}2-fibration with isomorphisms validates System F's entire equational theory on the nose, independently of the parameterizing meta-theory.Moreover, we offer a novel relationally parametric model of System F (after Orsanigo), which is proof-relevant in the sense that witnesses of relatedness are themselves suitably related. We show that, unlike previous frameworks for parametricity, ours recognizes this new model in a natural way. Our framework is thus descriptive, in that it accounts for well-known models, as well as prescriptive, in that it identifies abstract properties that good models of relational parametricity should satisfy and suggests new constructions of such models.},
