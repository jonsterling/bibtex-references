                  corresponding to the internal logic of the topos Sh
                  $\omega$ 1 of sheaves over $\omega$ 1. In contrast
                  to earlier work on abstract step-indexed models, we
                  not only construct the logical relations in the
                  guarded type theory, but also give an internal proof
                  of the adequacy of the model with respect to
                  standard contextual equivalence. To state and prove
                  adequacy of the logical relation, we introduce a new
                  propositional modality. In connection with this
                  modality we show why it is necessary to work in the
                  logic of bf Sh$\omega$ 1.",

                  possibly divergent computations for proving a result
                  which mentions systems involving only terminating
                  computations. Our proof is carried out in a
                  constructive metalanguage. This involves implicitly
                  a covering relation over arbitrary posets in formal
                  topology, which occurs in forcing in set theory in a
                  classical framework, but can also be defined

                  functional programming. The language supports both
                  function and process abstraction. Functions may be
                  defined and used within processes, and processes can
                  be dynamically created during expression
                  evaluation. In this work we present two different
                  descriptions of the operational semantics of
                  Facile. First, we develop a structural operational
                  semantics for a small core subset of Facile using a
                  labeled transition system. Such a semantics is
                  useful for reasoning about the operational behavior
                  of Facile programs. We then provide an abstract
                  model of implementation for Facile: theConcurrent
                  and Functional Abstract Machine (C-FAM). The C-FAM
                  executes concurrent processes evaluating functional
                  expressions. The implementation semantics includes
                  compilation rules from Facile to C-FAM instructions
                  and execution rules for the abstract machine. This
                  level of semantic description is suitable for those
                  interested in implementations.",

                  more sophisticated data types in which the data have
                  an associated indices which can be used to store
                  important computational information. The crucial and
                  salient feature of dependent polynomials and indexed
                  containers is that the index types are defined in
                  advance of the data. At the most sophisticated
                  level, induction-recursion allows us to define data

                  with a P f P f -coalgebra on the set of atomic
                  propositions in the program. The corresponding C(P f
                  P f )-coalgebra, where C(P f P f ) is the cofree
                  comonad on P f P f , describes derivations by
                  resolution. Using lax semantics, that correspondence
                  may be extended to a class of first-order logic
                  programs without existential variables. The
                  resulting extension captures the proofs by
                  term-matching resolution in logic
                  programming. Refining the lax ap- proach, we further
                  extend it to arbitrary logic programs. We also
                  exhibit a refinement of Bonchi and Zanasi?s
                  saturation semantics for logic pro- gramming that
                  complements lax semantics.},

                  variant of ML, allows an entire distributed
                  application to be developed and reasoned about as a
                  unified program. The language supports transparent
                  mobility of any kind of code or data, but its type
                  system, based on modal logic, statically excludes
                  programs that use mobile resources unsafely. The ML5
                  compiler produces code for all of the hosts that may
                  be involved in the computation. These hosts may be
                  heterogeneous, with different resources and even
                  different architectures. Currently, our compiler and
                  runtime are specialized to the particular case of

                  dependent types on top of the Coq proof
                  assistant. This language permits to establish a
                  phase distinction between writing and proving
                  algorithms in the Coq environment. Concretely, this
                  means allowing to write algorithms as easily as in a
                  practical functional programming language whilst
                  giving them as rich a specification as desired and
                  proving that the code meets the specification using
                  the whole Coq proof apparatus. This is achieved by
                  extending conversion to an equivalence which relates
                  types and subsets based on them, a technique
                  originating from the ``Predicate subtyping'' feature
                  of PVS and following mathematical convention. The
                  typing judgements can be translated to the (CIC) by
                  means of an interpretation which inserts coercions
                  at the appropriate places. These coercions can
                  contain existential variables representing the
                  propositional parts of the final term, corresponding
                  to proof obligations (or PVS type-checking
                  conditions). A prototype implementation of this
                  process is integrated with the Coq environment."

                  remarks concerning the subject which was later
                  called "intuitionistic logic." His strict
                  algorithmic point of view led to rejecting the Ex
                  Falso principle and, unfortunately, to many other
                  consequences. The Ex Falso principle was also
                  rejected in Kolmogorov's 1925 paper on
                  logic. However, in 1932, using the "intended
                  interpretation" (interpretation problem), Kolmogorov
                  concluded that this rule should be
                  accepted. Heyting's proof interpretation led to the
                  same conclusion. Here the role of implication and
                  negation in the Ex Falso principle in the works of
                  Brouwer, Kolmogorov, and Heyting is studied. It is
                  asserted that the 1907 point of view of Brouwer is
                  too strict to create a satisfactory logic, and
                  Brouwer exceeds the bounds of minimal logic in his
                  understanding of implication. The above points of
                  view are compared, and it is concluded that the
                  interpretation problem and the proof interpretation,
                  understood correctly, admit the full intuitionistic
                  logic.}

                  Brouwer's view, was an intellectual activity of men
                  (of the subject), independent of language and
                  logic. The objects of mathematics come first in the
                  process of human cognition, and description and
                  systematization (in particular logic) follow
                  later. The formulation of the ur-intuition is

  abstract =     {In total functional (co)programming valid programs
                  are guaranteed to always produce (part of) their
                  output in a finite number of steps. Enforcing this
                  property while not sacrificing expressivity has been
                  challenging. Traditionally systems like Agda and Coq
                  have relied on a syntactic restriction on
                  (co)recursive calls, but this is inherently
                  anti-modular. Guarded recursion, first introduced by
                  Nakano, has been recently applied in the
                  coprogramming case to ensure totality through typing
                  instead. The relationship between the consumption
                  and the production of data is captured by a delay
                  modality, which allows to give a safe type to a
                  general fixpoint combinator. This thesis consists of
                  two parts. In the first we formalize, using the
                  proof assistant Agda, a result about strong
                  normalization for a small language extended with
                  guarded recursive types. In the second we extend
                  guarded recursive types to additionally ensure
                  termination of recursive programs: the main result
                  is a model based on relational parametricity for the
                  dependently typed calculus we designed. },
